# Usage
In order to run the application, run this in the terminal:
```ps
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Then, scan the QR code that is displayed in the terminal on your mobile device. You will need to install the Expo Go app on your phone first. You can also test the app on your PC (there are options for this presented in the status display in the terminal).

Watch the terminal for any errors when the app starts.
